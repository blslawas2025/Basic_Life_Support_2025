This guide shows how to integrate the modern Results & Analytics screen with Supabase to store and display comprehensive test results including name, IC, job position, and pre/post test results.

## ðŸ“Š What's Included

### 1. Enhanced Database Schema
- **test_submissions table** with all required fields:
  - `user_name`, `user_email`, `ic_number`
  - `job_position_name`, `job_category` (clinical/non_clinical)
  - `test_type` (pre_test/post_test)
  - `score`, `correct_answers`, `total_questions`
  - `time_taken_seconds`, `submitted_at`
- **test_analytics view** for comprehensive reporting

### 2. Updated Services

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Schema
```bash

node scripts/setup_enhanced_analytics.js
```

### Step 2: Update Test Completion
In your test completion logic, use the new saveTestResult method:

```typescript
import { SubmissionService } from '../services/SubmissionService';

// When a test is completed
const result = await SubmissionService.saveTestResult(
  userId,                    // User ID from profiles table
  testType,                  // 'pre_test' or 'post_test'
  score,                     // Final score
  totalQuestions,            // Total questions (usually 30)
  correctAnswers,            // Number of correct answers
  timeTakenSeconds,          // Time taken in seconds
  courseSessionId            // Optional course session ID
);
```
